    "Structure: SQL databases are relational databases, which means they use tables to store data. Each table consists of rows and columns, and relationships between tables are defined through foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema that defines the structure of the data. The schema specifies the tables, columns, data types, and constraints for the database.\n",

    "Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. SQL is a powerful language for complex queries and transactions.\n",

    "Consistency: SQL databases prioritize data consistency, adhering to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. This ensures that data remains in a consistent state even in the presence of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling: SQL databases are typically scaled vertically, which means you can increase their capacity by adding more resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to a single server. Vertical scaling has limits in terms of scalability.\n",

    "\n",
    "Schema: NoSQL databases are schema-less or schema-flexible, meaning you can add or change fields without affecting the entire database. This flexibility is well-suited for rapidly changing data.\n",

    "Query Language: NoSQL databases use different query languages, often specific to the type of database. For example, MongoDB uses a query language that works with JSON-like documents.\n",
